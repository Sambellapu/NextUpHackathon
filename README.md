Vacation/Itineraries

Theme: Vacation/Itineraries

Create a Vacation Simulator, a text-based adventure program where users go on a virtual summer vacation and make choices that shape their journey. 

The program should present different scenarios, like going to the beach, hiking in the mountains, or exploring a city, and allow the user to choose 
what to do at each step. Their decisions affect outcomes such as energy level, fun score, or unexpected events like getting sunburned or finding a hidden spot. 
Include features like branching storylines, random events, and a final trip 
summary based on the user's experience.
